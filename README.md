# HabitTracker

Keeps track of your habits. Habits include titles, bios, and checklists. Checklists represent your completion of the habit in the last 7 days. Habits are easily added, removed, and edited. Checklists are easily updated via check and x marks located in each square. 

Long term plans are to flesh out the project and create a web server that keeps track of habits over long periods of time. Has functionality that helps you keep your habits. And offers data that can help the user understand when they succeed and when they fail. 

To Dos
- Fix some bugs that occur when you add many unedited habits. 
  - These bugs occur because many habits have the same name, which is the identifier for my habits. 
  - Easy solution would be to prevent the user from having multiple habits with the same name.
- Allow ability to remove check/x marks from your checklist.
